TAKEAWAY #1: RENDER TEMPLATE
return render(request, 'name of template.html') (provided that templates folder exists in same directory)

TAKEAWAY #2: SERVE STATIC FILES IN DEVELOPMENT!
JUST HAVE A STATIC FOLDER INSIDE YOUR APP WITH THE NESSECARY FILES!

TAKEAWAY #3: DATABASES - SETUP
1. GO TO MODELS.PY OF THE APP, MAKE CLASSES FOR EACH THING YOU WANT TO STORE
2. ALL DATA IN CLASSES MUST BE SOME TYPE OF DATA FIELD. EG. CHARFIELD, INTEGERFIELD
3. WHEN DONE SETTING EVERYTHING UP, RUN MAKEMIGRATIONS AND MIGRATE
4. TO ADD DATA MANUALLY, run manage.py with python then import the model you want to make
   make objects with that model's blueprint then save the object
   >>> from connect4.models import Player
   >>> p1 = Player(name='bob', wins=0)
   >>> p1.save()

TAKEAWAY #4.1: DATABASES - MAKING A POST REQUEST TO CHANGE DATABASE
1. Use the fetch API, and override the method, request body (contains data to send to server), headers (inform server what is being recieved)
1.1. After the server processes the request and returns something, fetch works the same way as GET requests

***REMEMBER TO STRINGIFY the request body, as this is how the servers communicate (not JSON)***

fetch('url to fetch', {
   method: 'POST', 
   body: JSON.stringify({
      'deez nuts': 10
   }), 
   headers: {
      'content-type': 'application/json'
   }
}).then(
   res => res.json()
).then(
   data => console.log(data)
);

TAKEAWAY #4.2: DATABASE QUERIES
1. import the model into the views file, where the server requests are handled
2. Use .filter(), .exclude(), .all(), .get(), to obtain the entry that you want to modify
2.1. Note that all except .get() return a QuerySet, so you still need to pick what in the QuerySet you want to modify (using indicies)
3. Use .save() to update the entry in the database (you can also do this to create new entries)
4. .delete() exists to remove all elements of a QuerySet

TAKEAWAY #5: FORMS DON'T WAIT FOR PROMISES
- to fix, return false on onsubmit and submit the form manually if the promise goes well
- to generalize, think about putting more JS in html as an option

TAKEAWAY #6: ForeignKey and OneToOneField
- take in another class the field is being mapped to and on_delete parameter
